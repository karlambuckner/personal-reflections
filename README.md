# _Personal Reflections_

#### _An evaluation of where I am at and where I would like to be as a programmer, November 3rd, 2017_

## Reflecting

_Coding school has been an intense and fast paced learning experience. I would be lying if I said it wasn't stressful at times, however, I've also really enjoyed it and learned so much. With that being said, it's nice to take a moment and reflect on my progress or where I've struggled._

## Before Epicodus

_Before attending Epicodus I didn't know much about programming. I knew programmers in town and became more curious about it the more I talked with them. I knew it could be a great career opportunity and thought it would be something I would enjoy doing and learning about. I started by taking some of the CodeAcademy tutorials in my spare time. I realized that I was pretty decent at it and had a lot of fun along the way._

_Then a friend told me about Epicodus and now months later it's hard to believe how far I've come. From making basic HTML pages to doing full-on Ruby and JavaScript, to attending meet-ups and networking with other programmers, to working with teams and partners making awesome projects. While I've come a considerably long way in just months, I also know there is so much I can still learn and excel at and I'm up for the challenge._

## Room for Improvement

_The following are things that I struggle with and would like to improve or things I feel need attention_

* _Talking confidently about my code_
* _Technical interviews/white boarding_
* _Getting back to the basics and fully understanding the terminology_
* _Completing projects and cleaning up my Github_
* _Updating my Portfolio_

## White Board Practice

## Researching the Interview Process

_I went to Powell's and found books on the coding interview and how to be a better programmer and approach problems with better strategies. The book "The Pragmatic Programmer" was recommended at a Ruby Brigade meetup at New Relic so I got that for future reading. I found an awesome diagram of how to go through the process of learing to program to getting a job. I realized I have a lot of work I can still do. Making a resume is something I know is to come and will need to do. Practicing technical interviews and practicing behaviorial interview questions is definitely something I need to spend 10-15 minutes a day doing to feel more comfortable and confident._
