# _Personal Reflections_

#### _An evaluation of where I am at and where I would like to be as a programmer, November 3rd, 2017_

## Reflecting

_Coding school has been an intense and fast-paced learning experience. I would be lying if I said it wasn't stressful at times, however, I've also really enjoyed it and learned so much. With that being said, it's nice to take a moment and reflect on my progress and how I can improve moving forward._

## Before Epicodus

_Before attending Epicodus I didn't know much about programming. I knew it could be a great career opportunity and thought it would be something I would enjoy doing and learning about. I started by taking some of the CodeAcademy tutorials in my spare time. I realized that I was pretty decent at it and had fun learning about it._

_Then a friend told me about Epicodus and now months later it's hard to believe how far I've come. From making basic HTML pages to doing full-on Ruby and JavaScript, to attending meet-ups and networking with other programmers, to working with teams and partners making awesome projects. While I've come a considerably long way in just months, I also know there is so much I can still learn and ways that I can excel._

## Room for Improvement

_The following are things that I struggle with and would like to improve or things I feel need attention:_

* _Talking confidently about my code_
* _Technical interviews/white boarding_
* _Getting back to the basics and fully understanding the terminology_
* _Completing projects and cleaning up my Github_
* _Updating my Portfolio_

## White Board Practice

_I have had very little experience with white board technical interviews. To feel more confident about them, I worked out a few JavaScript problems I found online. Instead of trying to do it on my own, I worked them out the way that was provided so I could see the best approach of solving that problem. That way, I can apply it to the problems I do on my own later and feel more confident in doing so. I think it was important for me to see what is expected and truly understand the process. Because I knew the code was correct, I went back through and could confidently talk through what was happening. Below are just two examples of problems I worked on today._

## Researching the Interview Process

_I wanted to find resources on coding interviews and problem solving so I went to Powell's. The book "The Pragmatic Programmer" was recommended at a Ruby Brigade meetup at New Relic so I got that for future reading. I also found a book called "Cracking the Coding Interview". In it was an awesome diagram of how to go through the process from learing to program to getting a job. I realized I have a lot of work I can still do. Making a resume is something I know is to come and will need to do. Practicing technical interviews and practicing behaviorial interview questions is definitely something I need to spend 10-15 minutes a day doing. I also need to clean up my Github, because that's essentaily its own resume of my work. This is something I could spend an hour a week doing. Below is the diagram I mentioned._

## Updating my Portfolio 

_I didn't realize just how far I have come until I looked back at my old portfolio to work on updating it. Here is a screenshot of the simple html/css portfolio project I did in Intro to Programming:_

_I made several changes to my Portfolio. First, I made the styling more professional by toning down the colors and adding a font. I updated the information in my "about me" to be more career/programming focused. I added links to my more recent github projects that I am proud of. I added JavaScript files and updated my README. To see commits for this project visit https://github.com/karlambuckner/portfolio I plan on updating it further, especially when done with Rails and after cleaning up my github. Below is a screenshot of my updated portfolio:_
